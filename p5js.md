# Getting started with p5.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a JavaScript library for creative coding and making graphics. It came from [Processing](https://processing.org/), a Java project, but we'll be using p5.js because writing in JavaScript makes your project easier to share with friends.

## Create a project

### Web Editor

The easiest way to get started is to use the [web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). Code away!

We have a [sample p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/wxs/sketches/SqpdyZVCG) sketch to display your webcam in case you want to play with the OBS example.

### VS Code

If you already use VS Code, you can code in p5.js straight from there. Install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode), then follow the instructions on that page.

### Hard mode

If you use a different IDE or just a plain text editor, you can set up p5.js manually. Take a look at the [downloads](https://p5js.org/download/) page, you probably want the "complete library" download that comes with an example project.

## Learning

All your learning can be done on the [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/). If you're totally new to this, you'll want to read their [Get Started](https://p5js.org/get-started/) page. After that, go wild! They have lots of helpful other pages like [Learn](https://p5js.org/learn/), [Examples](https://p5js.org/examples/), and of course the [Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/).

## Advanced Projects

If you're interested in simulating physics and natural systems, check out [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/), a free online book that uses p5.js.
